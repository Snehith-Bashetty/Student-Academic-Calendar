# Student-Academic-Calendar
## Description of main modules 
	  Based on the use cases, we have implemented this project by dividing the work into modules â€“ Login,Add Event, Insert Event, Updating Event, Delete Event, View Event.

### LOGIN
	    In order for a user(Teacher) to login to STUDENT ACADEMIC CALENDAR, he/she must be registered user. First, the system will prompt the user to enter his/her credentials. 	    Once, the user enters his/her credentials, we check whether it matches with the information in the database. If a match is found, the user gets access to STUDENT ACADEMIC CALENDAR.

### ADD EVENTS
	    The Teacher can add any event as and when required to the calendar so that students can go through the same and plan accordingly.
### VIEW EVENTS
	    Both the teacher and students can  view the events on particular day to plan their schedule accordingly.
### UPDATE EVENTS
	    The teacher can update the events as and when required so that it will be reflected in the calendar and student will get to know.
### DELETE EVENT
	     The teacher can delete the events as and when required so that it will be reflected in the calendar and student will get to know.
